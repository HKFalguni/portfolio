For the past couple of months, I have been working on an app called Questo.  Questo is an app that I, along with my team of three, created to help you everyday student learn faster and more enjoyably. [Questo ](http://getquesto.com) generates a set of quizzes based on any text you provide.  This app was originally created for an IBM sponsored hackathon which we came first in.

Preparing for an official launch of the app in Summer 2017, we started rolling out our TestFlight Beta. If you are interested, please sign up over at [Questo App](http://getquesto.com).

I've had very enjoyable experience working on questo and it has helped me broaden my skill base, improve my communications skill and better understand what needs to go into an app to make it successful.

Want to work together? I'd love to hear from you.
